## Introduction

The idea of this thesis:

In the first chapter, basic ideas regarding volatility modeling are presented.
In the second chapter, we introduce the concept of fractional Brownian motion(fBm).
In the third chapter we talk about an actual model of rough volatility, which relies heavily on fBm.
In the fourth chapter we look at an extension for derivative pricing.

## Summary of chapter 1

In chapter 1 there were 3 main parts

The first talked about some generic facts about volatility and modeling assets, both theoretical and practical aspects.
One practical aspect which is sometimes neglected in theory is leverage - the more debt a firm has w.r.t. its earning, its volatility is going to be higher.
In practice volatility also clusters and has a long memory.

The next part talked about how to actually find the volatility of a stock price.
One method was using the derived from the Black & Scholes framework.
This is inconsistent with practice because in practice the volatility is not constant.Another idea was time-dependent volatility model, which is still built upon B&S.
It considers the dynamic of a stock price with time-dependent(yet deterministic) volatility:

$\displaystyle \frac{dS(t)}{S(t)} = \mu dt + \sigma(t)dW(t)$

Merton(1973) proposed the pricing formula using dependent volatility.
If we use the annualized variance:

$\displaystyle \sigma_a=\sqrt{\frac{1}{T-t}\int_t^T\sigma^2(\tau)d\tau}$

And view $\sigma_a$ as a constant dependent upon $t$ and $T$, you can plug it into B&S and receive a formula which when solved gives you time-dependent volatility.
Local volatility and mixture models were also mentioned in this part.

The last part talks about the following model: $\displaystyle \frac{dS(t)}{S(t)} = \mu_t dt + \sigma(t)dW(t)_1$

The stock price is driven by the wiener process $W_1$ and $\mu_t$ is the drift term.
However the volatility $\sigma(t)$ now is also stochastic.
Typically the volatility will be governed by a SDE which is driven by another Wiener process $W_2$ that is correlated with $W_1$.
The author then described popular SDEs that are used with this model.
For example:

-   Scott(1987)

$\displaystyle dS(t) = \mu_1S(t)dt + \sigma(t)S(t)^{\kappa}dW_1(t),$

$\displaystyle d\sigma(t) = \mu_2\sigma(t)dt+\delta\sigma^{\beta}(t)dW_2(t)$

and that is the end of chapter 1.

## Summary of chapter 2

Here it gets interesting.
The idea is to replace the usual Brownian motion with a fractional Brownian motion(fBm) in a SDE model.
To do that we need to define an integral on fBm, and figure out a lot of basic properties.
Lets do it!

A short preliminary for myself:

### (Preliminary) Gaussian process

***Definition Gaussian random variable** An* $\mathbb{R}^d$-valued random variable $\xi=(\xi_1,...,\xi_d)$ is called a Gaussian random variable if, for any $y\in\mathbb{R}^d$, $<y,\xi>$ is a real-valued Gaussian random variable.

If $\xi$ is an $\mathbb{R}^d$-valued Gaussian random variable, we define, for $j=1,...,d$,$m_j=\mathbb{E}[\xi_j]$.
Then $m=(m_1,...,m_d)$ is called the mean of $\xi$.
The matrix $\sum=(\sum_{jk})$ defined by

$$
\sum_{jk} = \mathbb{E}[(\xi_j-m_j)(\xi_k-m_k)]
$$

is called the covariance matrix of $\xi$.

A real-values process $X=(X_t:t\ge0)$ is called a **Gaussian process** if, for any $n\ge1$ and $0\le t_1 \le... \le t_n < \infty$, $(X_{t_1},...,X_{t_n})$ is a Gaussian random variable.

If $X$ is a Gaussian process, we may define:

$$
m(t) = \mathbb{E}[X_t], \quad t\ge0
$$

$$
\sum(s,t)=\mathbb{E}[(X_s-m(s))(X_t-m(t))],\quad s,t\ge0
$$

$m(t)$ is the mean function, $\sum(s,t)$ is called the covariance kernel.
If $\forall t:m(t)=0$ then $X$ is called a centered Gaussian process.
The Gaussian process is characterized by mean and covariance kernel.

**Proposition:** A standard 1-dimensional Brownian motion is a centered Gaussian process with covariance kernel $\sum(s,t)=s \wedge t = min(s,t)$

So a Brownian motion is actually a centered Gaussian process, but not the only one.
We will now see other forms of Gaussian processes.

### Elementary properties of fBm

***Definition: fraction Brownian motion (fBm)** A centered Gaussian process* $B^H=\{B_t^H,t\in\mathbb{R}\}$ is called a two-sided fractional Brownian motion (fBm) with Hurst parameter $H\in(0,1)$ if it has covariance function:

$\displaystyle R_H(t,s)=E[B_t^HB_s^H] = \frac{1}{2}(s^{2H}+t^{2H}-|t-s|^{2H})$ $s,t\in\mathbb{R}$

As we have previously seen, this fact (centered+covariance) uniquely determines the distribution.

**Definition: homogeneous function** A *homogeneous function* $f$ of variables $x$ and $y$ is a real-values function that satisfies

$$
f(tx,ty)=t^kf(x,y)
$$

for some constant $k$ and all real numbers $t$.
$k$ is also called *the degree of homogeneity.*

**Definition: self similar** A stochastic process $(X_t)_{t\ge0}$ is called *self-similar* if there exists a real number $H>0$ such that for any $c>0$ the processes $(X_{ct})_{t\ge0}$ and $(c^HX_t)_{t\ge0}$ have the same finite dimensional distributions.

Fact - fBm has homogeneous covariance function, and fBm is self similar.

Fact - $\mathbb{E}[|B_t^H - B_s^H|^2]=|t-s|^{2H}\quad s,t\in\mathbb{R}$ , which implies stationary increments

**Theorem: Kolmogorov-Chentsov Continuity Theorem.** Assume that for a stochastic process $\{X_t, t\ge0\}$ such that for $s,t,\in[0,T]$ and $T\ge0$,

$$
\mathbb{E}[|X_t - X_s|^p]\le|t-s|^{1+\beta},
$$

with positive constants $p,\beta,D$.
Then there exists a continuous modification $\hat X$ of $X$, i.e.

1.  $\hat X$ has **continuous paths**.
2.  $P(X_t=\hat X_t)=1$ for $t\in[0,T]$

Furthermore, the process $\hat X$ is $\kappa$-Holder continuous, i.e for any $0<\kappa<\frac{\beta}{p}$

$$
\sup_{0\le s<t\le T} \frac{|\hat X_t - \hat X_s|}{(t-s)^\kappa}<\infty
$$

This Theorem can be applied for fBm.
This is useful because in the near future we may just look at fBm as continuous, implicitly choosing always the continuous modification of the process.

Fact - when the Hurst parameter $H=\frac{1}{2}$ then we receive the standard Brownian motion: $B_t^{\frac{1}{2}}$, with covariance $\mathbb{E}[B_t^{\frac{1}{2}}B_s^{\frac{1}{2}}] = min(|s|,|t|)$ .

Fact: If we define $R_H(n)$ where $s+h\le t, \quad t-s=nh$ as :

$$
R_H(n)=\mathbb{E}[(B_{t+h}-B_t)(B_{s+h}-B_s)]
$$

Then:

1.  When $H\in(0,\frac{1}{2})$, $R_H(n)<0$ then the increments are negatively correlated and the process presents counter persistence. Furthermore: $\sum_{n=1}^\infty |R_H(n)|<\infty$
2.  When $H\in(\frac{1}{2},1), R_H(n)>0$ then the increments are positively correlated and the process is persistent. Furthermore: $\sum_{n=1}^\infty R_H(n)=\infty$

Fact: when the Hurst parameter $H\in(0,\frac{1}{2})\cup(\frac{1}{2}, 1)$, **the increments of the fBm on disjoint intervals are not independent.**

Fact: fBm is not semimartingale.
